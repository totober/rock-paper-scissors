# rock-paper-scissors

Here im going to practice some JavaScript.
This exercise of The Odin Project consist in a really famous game called "rock, papaer and scissors".
I think no more introduction to the game is needed.
Ideally im going to implement, also, the "programmer thinking", not only JS. 
This is a really interesting part of coding, wich includes mainly planning, restarting and dividing/reducing the problem.
